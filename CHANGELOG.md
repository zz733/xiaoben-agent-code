- **Codex approval prompts no longer hang** Fixes a regression introduced in 0.1.70 where Codex agents would wait forever on command and file approvals — the prompt never reached the app and the agent stayed stuck in "running" ([#866](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/pull/866), [#869](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/pull/869))
- **Windows: daemon no longer crashes when Codex emits non-JSON output** Localized stdout lines from the Codex CLI are now ignored instead of taking down the daemon worker ([#866](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/pull/866))
- Drag-and-drop images onto the new workspace screen now works ([#850](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/pull/850))
- Archiving a worktree from the toolbar redirects you immediately instead of leaving you on the dead screen for a beat ([#852](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/pull/852))
- Pi-backed sessions now shut down cleanly when you close them, releasing extension resources on the Pi side ([#863](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/pull/863))

## 0.1.71 - 2026-05-09

### Added

- **Import existing Claude, Codex, and OpenCode sessions** into Paseo — pick up a conversation you started in the terminal and keep going from the app, with the full timeline ([#766](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/pull/766), [#833](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/pull/833))
- **Subagents now appear in a collapsible section above the composer** so you can jump into agents your main agent spawned ([#532](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/pull/532))
- Merge a pull request directly from the checkout pane ([#814](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/pull/814))

- Clicking a Markdown link in agent output no longer reloads the desktop app on top of opening the link
- macOS desktop tab-jump shortcuts now use Cmd+Option+1-9, avoiding conflicts with Option-based international keyboard characters such as `@`

### Security

- Local state files (daemon keypair, stored credentials, persisted config) are now readable only by the owning user ([#825](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/pull/825) by [@joaosa](https://github.com/joaosa))

## 0.1.70 - 2026-05-08

### Breaking

- **Claude agents now require `claude` on your PATH** Install Claude Code globally (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`) before running a Claude agent — Paseo no longer ships a bundled fallback binary. Same posture as Codex and OpenCode, and shrinks the desktop install by ~210 MB per platform

### Added

- Non-GitHub project display names are derived from the remote owner/repo instead of the local path
- Desktop IPC wrapped in shared mutation/query hooks, fixing stale state and intermittent failures ([#761](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/issues/761))
- `paseo schedule create --host` now requires `--cwd` to avoid running schedules in the wrong directory
- `paseo schedule create --every` runs once immediately by default, then on the configured interval
- MCP `create_agent` validates the requested mode and refuses silent cross-provider inheritance

- Review comment UI is cleaner and easier to scan
- The daemon's `/api/status` endpoint is now protected by password auth when one is configured

### Fixed

- **Apple Silicon Mac:** The desktop update pipeline now publishes manifests atomically, closing a race that could install the Intel build on Apple Silicon Macs and cause 100%+ renderer CPU usage. Affected users will self-heal — electron-updater's Rosetta detection migrates back to arm64 on the next update poll ([#555](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/issues/555))
- **Linux:** `.deb` and `.rpm` packages now show as `Paseo` in the dock and process list instead of `Paseo.bin`. `--no-sandbox` is now scoped to AppImage only, matching VS Code's sandbox handling ([#602](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo/issues/602))

- Desktop Integrations settings — install the Paseo CLI and orchestration skills directly from the app without touching the terminal
- Daemon status dialog in desktop settings for quick health checks
- Auto-restart daemon on version mismatch — the desktop app detects when the running daemon is outdated and restarts it automatically
