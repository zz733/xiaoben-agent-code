# Design

Tokens — every color, font size, weight, spacing step, radius, icon size — live in `packages/app/src/styles/theme.ts`.

---

## 1. Character

Paseo is minimal, spacious, quiet, confident. Whitespace is deliberate. Nothing crowds, nothing decorates, nothing apologizes. A row, a label, a control. That is the bar.

The app is calm so the user's work is not. Every visual decision serves either _act on this_ or _understand this_ — never _look at this_.

Consistency comes from component reuse, not from hand-matching styles across surfaces. A row in the projects list, a row in settings, and a row in a modal are the same component, not three implementations that happen to look alike. When two surfaces do the same semantic thing in two different ways, one of them is wrong.

---

## 2. Component reuse

A semantic element used in three or more places is a primitive. One of a kind is a screen.

Primitives live in `packages/app/src/components/ui/` and `packages/app/src/components/headers/`. Card and row layout live in `packages/app/src/styles/settings.ts`. Section structure lives in `packages/app/src/screens/settings/settings-section.tsx`.

A pressable styled to look like a button is wrong; the button is `<Button>` (`packages/app/src/components/ui/button.tsx`). A bare `<Text>` styled to look like a section header is wrong; the section header is `<SettingsSection>` (`packages/app/src/screens/settings/settings-section.tsx`). A custom `Modal` for a confirmation is wrong; the confirmation is `confirmDialog` (`packages/app/src/utils/confirm-dialog.ts`). A hand-rolled overflow menu is wrong; the menu is `<DropdownMenu>` (`packages/app/src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx`). A hand-rolled status pill is wrong; the pill is `<StatusBadge>` (`packages/app/src/components/ui/status-badge.tsx`).

Before adding a new component, read `components/ui/`. The primitive usually exists.

---

## 3. Hierarchy

Hierarchy is conveyed through weight and color, not size. Most labels, titles, and hints across the app are `fontSize.base` or `fontSize.xs`. The distinction between a row's primary line and its secondary line is `foreground` versus `foregroundMuted`.

Weight has three tiers, applied by role:

- **Screen titles** — the title at the top of a screen — use `<ScreenTitle>` (`packages/app/src/components/headers/screen-title.tsx`), which renders `fontSize.base` at weight `400` on compact and `300` on desktop. Top-of-screen titles are lighter on desktop, not heavier. The workspace screen header follows the same rule (`packages/app/src/screens/workspace/workspace-screen.tsx`).
- **Structural labels** use `fontWeight.medium`. This applies to section labels above a stack of rows (`packages/app/src/components/agent-list.tsx:519-523`, `packages/app/src/components/keyboard-shortcuts-dialog.tsx:63-67`), form field labels above an input inside a modal (`packages/app/src/components/add-host-modal.tsx:19-23`, `packages/app/src/components/pair-link-modal.tsx:24-28`), the title at the top of a modal/sheet/dialog (`packages/app/src/components/adaptive-modal-sheet.tsx:90-94`, `packages/app/src/components/ui/combobox.tsx:1607-1611`, `packages/app/src/components/welcome-screen.tsx:48-53`), action button labels in tight components such as the sidebar callout actions (`packages/app/src/components/sidebar-callout.tsx:218-221`), and inline data emphasis on dense metadata rows (`packages/app/src/components/git-diff-pane.tsx:2322-2327`, `packages/app/src/components/file-explorer-pane.tsx:1115-1122`).
- **Content** uses `fontWeight.normal`. This applies to settings rows (`packages/app/src/styles/settings.ts`), sidebar primary list-item titles (`packages/app/src/components/sidebar-workspace-list.tsx:2680-2686`, `packages/app/src/components/agent-list.tsx:572-578`), `<Button>` text (`packages/app/src/components/ui/button.tsx:80-84`), `<StatusBadge>` text (`packages/app/src/components/ui/status-badge.tsx:56-60`), and `<SidebarCallout>` titles (`packages/app/src/components/sidebar-callout.tsx:175-180`).

The rule, condensed: text that _names_ a surface or a group is `medium`. Text that lives _inside_ a surface or a group is `normal`. Top-of-screen titles are `<ScreenTitle>`, which is lighter still.

Foreground is for the thing being acted on: row titles, section headings, the selected sidebar item. `foregroundMuted` is for context: hints, descriptions, secondary metadata, idle sidebar items, placeholders, status text.

Accent is the one CTA per surface. A `<Button variant="default">` filled with `accent` appears at most once on a page. Most pages have zero — settings is mostly toggles and text, the workspace pane is mostly content, the chat composer is the input itself.

Destructive is a color, not a click. Restart-daemon and remove-host are `<Button variant="outline">` in the row trailing slot; the destructive surface only appears inside the `confirmDialog` (`packages/app/src/screens/settings/host-page.tsx:541-547`). Workspace archive opens a confirm dialog before any red appears (`packages/app/src/components/sidebar-workspace-list.tsx`). Red appears after the user has indicated intent.

---

## 4. Buttons

The button is `<Button>` (`packages/app/src/components/ui/button.tsx`). It has five variants. Each has one job.

`default` is the one primary action on a surface — filled with `accent`. At most one per page. The primary slot inside an `<AdaptiveModalSheet>` and the highlighted action on the welcome screen are the canonical uses.

`secondary` is the paired action when two actions carry equal weight — filled with `surface3`. The component default is `secondary`, which matches its frequency in the codebase.

`outline` is the low-frequency action that lives on a row — transparent with `borderAccent`. Restart, Remove, Update on host detail (`packages/app/src/screens/settings/host-page.tsx:585-594`).

`ghost` is structural and non-committal — no border, no fill. Back arrows, header toggles, "Load more" footers (`packages/app/src/screens/sessions-screen.tsx:54-63`), more-affordances. Ghost is used when the affordance is part of the chrome, not a decision.

`destructive` is filled with `destructive`. It only appears inside a confirm. The button on the page is `outline`; the destructive button is the confirm button inside the dialog.

Sizes: `xs` for ultra-tight inline triggers. `sm` for any button sitting in a row. `md` is the page default. `lg` is reserved for large standalone CTAs.

A `<Pressable>` wrapping a `<Text>` is a sixth variant. It is wrong. `<Button>` accepts `style`, `textStyle`, `leftIcon`, `disabled`, `size`, and `variant`.

---

## 5. Borders

Borders group, separate, or rarely emphasize.

A logical block of related rows lives inside a card — one border around the whole group. The card primitive is `settingsStyles.card`; the keyboard-shortcuts dialog uses the same shape inline (`packages/app/src/components/keyboard-shortcuts-dialog.tsx:68-73`). The border defines what belongs together.

Rows after the first inside a card carry `settingsStyles.rowBorder` — a single top border. The first row never has one. The same divider pattern appears in the keyboard-shortcuts dialog rows (`packages/app/src/components/keyboard-shortcuts-dialog.tsx:74-83`). Rows do not need their own background to feel separated.

A list that is itself the page content — sidebar items in `sidebar-workspace-list.tsx`, the workspace list, the agent list (`packages/app/src/components/agent-list.tsx`) — uses spacing and surface, not borders, to separate items. Rows-in-a-card is an interior pattern; lists-as-pages are not.

Pane chrome — the workspace pane header, the file-explorer header, the diff pane header — uses a single bottom border to separate the header from the content (`packages/app/src/components/git-diff-pane.tsx:2328-2331`). One border, no shadow.

`borderAccent` is reserved for the outline button. Inputs use `border`. Single-thing borders are wrong; a single bordered element is either a card with one row (use the card) or it does not need a border.

---

## 6. Pickers

Five primitives. The pick is determined by option count, the need to search, and how the picker is anchored.

`<DropdownMenu>` is for a small fixed set anchored to a trigger. Theme picker, kebab menus on workspace and project rows (`packages/app/src/components/sidebar-workspace-list.tsx:684-770`), row "more" menus. Items can be async (`status: "pending"`) and can include destructive entries. Under ~10 options where the user knows what they're looking for.

`<Combobox>` is for a large or searchable list. Host switcher in the sidebar footer, model selector in the composer, branch switcher in the workspace header (`packages/app/src/components/branch-switcher.tsx`). The user types to find the option, or the list is long enough to scroll.

`<ContextMenu>` is for right-click and long-press on a target. The row is the trigger; there is no visible affordance. Used for incidental actions on workspace rows in the sidebar (`packages/app/src/components/sidebar-workspace-list.tsx`).

`<AdaptiveModalSheet>` is for a focused task. Multi-field forms (`packages/app/src/components/add-host-modal.tsx`, `packages/app/src/components/pair-link-modal.tsx`, `packages/app/src/components/project-picker-modal.tsx`), confirmations with detail, anything that earns a backdrop. Bottom sheet on compact, centered card on desktop. Raw `Modal` is wrong for any of these.

`<AdaptiveModalSheet>` owns compact bottom safe-area padding inside the sheet so the sheet background still reaches the screen bottom. If a sheet's first snap point is shorter than its header, content, and safe-area clearance, raise that snap point rather than moving the sheet container.

`confirmDialog` is for destructive yes/no and imperative confirmation. Promise-based: `await confirmDialog({ destructive: true, ... })`. Anything where a wrong click loses work.

Three themes is `DropdownMenu`. Thirty hosts is `Combobox`. A label and a value is `AdaptiveModalSheet`. "Are you sure?" is `confirmDialog`.

---

## 7. Density and rhythm

Settings detail pages, the projects detail page, and any list+detail content sit inside a centered, max-width 720 column (`packages/app/src/screens/settings-screen.tsx`, `packages/app/src/screens/projects-screen.tsx`). Lines stay readable, the eye does not have to track wide horizontal distances. Form modals carry their own narrower content frame (`packages/app/src/components/add-host-modal.tsx`).

Workspace and chat surfaces use the full width — these are working surfaces, not reading surfaces. The composer carries `MAX_CONTENT_WIDTH` from `packages/app/src/constants/layout.ts` to keep lines readable while letting the workspace pane fill the rest.

Sections sit apart. `<SettingsSection>` owns its own bottom margin; the next thing is wrapped in another `<SettingsSection>`. The agent-list `sectionHeading` carries the same `marginTop`/`marginBottom` rhythm (`packages/app/src/components/agent-list.tsx:511-517`). Adding `marginBottom` to a section is wrong.

Cards inside a section sit closer than sections. Rows inside a card touch — only the divider separates them. The rhythm is page → spacious; section → spacious; card → tight.

Rows have generous vertical padding: roughly 16px of content plus 16px of vertical padding for settings rows, 8–12px for sidebar list items where many rows must fit. Compressing rows below the established density to fit more on the screen is wrong. Too many rows means more cards or more sections, not smaller rows.

The whitespace is the design.

---

## 8. Responsiveness

Compact-first. The small case is designed; the large case adds chrome around it.

The list+detail pattern is canonical and reused across surfaces. The settings shell (`packages/app/src/screens/settings-screen.tsx`) and the projects screen (`packages/app/src/screens/projects-screen.tsx`) implement it identically:

- On compact: full-screen list with `<BackHeader>` at the top. Tapping a row pushes a full-screen detail with its own `<BackHeader>` that returns to the list.
- On desktop: a 320px sidebar on the left holds the list with `surfaceSidebar` background. The content pane on the right holds the selected detail with `<ScreenHeader>`, `<HeaderIconBadge>`, and `<ScreenTitle>`.

The branching is one `useIsCompactFormFactor()` check at the top of the screen component. The list and the detail are the same components in both layouts; only the framing changes.

The workspace screen (`packages/app/src/screens/workspace/workspace-screen.tsx`) follows a different but parallel rule: tabs collapse on compact, panes split on desktop. The sidebar (`packages/app/src/components/left-sidebar.tsx`) is overlaid on compact and pinned on desktop.

A new list+detail feature copies the settings shell. A new workspace-shaped feature copies the workspace shell. Inventing a third shape happens in design review, not in a PR.

---

## 9. Copy and voice

Sentence case. "Pair a device", "Danger zone", "Restart daemon", "Inject Paseo tools", "No sessions yet", "Load more". Proper nouns retain casing — Paseo, Beta, Stable, Local. Title case is wrong.

No trailing periods on row titles, labels, or buttons. No trailing period on a single-clause hint: "What happens when you press Enter while the agent is running" (`packages/app/src/screens/settings-screen.tsx:271-272`). Periods exist inside multi-sentence prose: "Restarts the daemon process. The app will reconnect automatically."

Empty-state strings are short noun phrases or short sentences: "No projects yet", "Select a project", "No sessions yet" (`packages/app/src/screens/sessions-screen.tsx:74-76`), "Host not found".

Buttons are imperative: Save, Cancel, Restart, Remove, Update, Install update, Add host, Load more. In-flight labels are present-participle with a literal three-dot ellipsis: "Saving...", "Restarting...", "Removing...", "Loading...".

Error copy is direct. "Unable to remove host" (`packages/app/src/screens/settings/host-page.tsx:697`), not "Sorry, we couldn't remove the host." Recovery instructions are concrete: "Wait for it to come online before restarting." Errors describe state; they do not editorialize.

Terminology:

- Workspace, never "checkout".
- Host, except where the user-facing concept is the daemon process itself ("Restart daemon").
- Project, not "repo" or "repository".
- Provider, not "model provider".
- Session and agent are distinct: a session is a historical entry in `sessions-screen.tsx`; an agent is a live entity in the workspace.

---

## 10. States

Loading is inline by default. `<LoadingSpinner size={14} color={foregroundMuted} />` sits next to the thing it relates to (`packages/app/src/screens/settings/providers-section.tsx:227-231`). Page-level loading is a centered `<LoadingSpinner size="large">` (`packages/app/src/screens/sessions-screen.tsx:69-72`). Card-level loading is a single short line, not a spinner. In-row dropdown items use `<DropdownMenuItem status="pending" pendingLabel="Removing...">`; the menu item handles its own pending state.

Empty states are short noun phrases. Centered, muted, one or two lines. Sessions screen pairs the empty noun with a single ghost button to navigate back (`packages/app/src/screens/sessions-screen.tsx:74-81`); that pairing is the maximum elaboration. Illustrations and CTAs disguised as empty states are wrong.

Inline errors are a single sentence in `palette.red[300]` `xs`, sitting under the field or inside the card it relates to (`packages/app/src/screens/settings/providers-section.tsx:115-119`).

Page-level alerts — informational notices, success confirmations, warnings, or recoverable errors that need a small visible block on the page — use `<Alert>` (`packages/app/src/components/ui/alert.tsx`). Variants: `default`, `info`, `success`, `warning`, `error`. The chrome is quiet by design: a 1px tinted border, transparent background, a small variant-tinted icon, the title in the variant accent, the description in `foregroundMuted`. Actions go in the `children` slot as `<Button variant="outline" size="sm">` — recovery actions are low-frequency and outline keeps them quiet alongside the alert's accent (`packages/app/src/screens/project-settings-screen.tsx`). One `<Alert>` at a time per region.

Sidebar callouts — cross-cutting alerts that apply across the whole app, like worktree setup, Rosetta install, and desktop update available — register through `useSidebarCallouts()` and render in the left sidebar via `<SidebarCallout>` (`packages/app/src/components/sidebar-callout.tsx`). The chrome (top-border-only, full-width action buttons) is tuned for that ~280px column. Canonical sources: `packages/app/src/components/worktree-setup-callout-source.tsx`, `packages/app/src/desktop/updates/rosetta-callout-source.tsx`, `packages/app/src/desktop/updates/update-callout-source.tsx`. Never import `<SidebarCallout>` into a page — that's what `<Alert>` is for.

Imperative errors are `Alert.alert("Error", "Unable to ...")` (the React Native `Alert` API, not this component) for failures that interrupt the flow and have no place on the page.

Disabled state is `opacity: theme.opacity[50]` on the outer pressable. Color changes for disabled state are wrong; a disabled button is the same button, dimmer.

Partial failure (a list mostly fine but one source errored) is a bordered banner above the list, listing each failure in red-300 `xs` (`packages/app/src/screens/projects-screen.tsx:151-159`). The list still renders.

State surfaces at the smallest scope it affects. Field error stays under the field; page error is a banner; flow-stopping error is an `Alert`.

---

## 11. List rows

The row anatomy is a content column with an optional trailing slot. Inside a card the row is `settingsStyles.row`. Inside a sidebar list the row carries its own padding and `borderRadius.lg` per item (`packages/app/src/components/sidebar-workspace-list.tsx:2614-2625`).

Rows that drill into a detail lead with a chevron in the trailing slot (`ChevronRight`, `iconSize.sm`, `foregroundMuted`). The whole row is the `<Pressable>`. Pair-device row (`packages/app/src/screens/settings/host-page.tsx:644-668`), provider row (`packages/app/src/screens/settings/providers-section.tsx:92-132`), project row in the projects list. Chevron means navigation.

Kebab menus (`<DropdownMenu>` with `<MoreVertical size={14} />` trigger) are for actions on the row, not navigation. Trigger style: `padding: 2`, `borderRadius: 4`, hover background `surface2`. Menu position: `align="end"`. Items use `<DropdownMenuItem leading={<Icon size={14} color={foregroundMuted} />} ...>`. Visibility is `isHovered || isTouchPlatform` — hover-revealed on web, always visible on native (`packages/app/src/components/sidebar-workspace-list.tsx:684-770`).

A row may carry both a chevron and a kebab when both navigation and row-level actions apply. Chevron sits at the end; kebab sits before it.

Switches and segmented controls also sit in the trailing slot. A row that both navigates and toggles is a `<Pressable>` with a `<Switch>` in the trailing slot — the switch calls `event.stopPropagation()` so the row press does not fire (`packages/app/src/screens/settings/providers-section.tsx:92-132`). Sidebar items that hold a status dot, a count, and a kebab follow the same rule (`packages/app/src/components/sidebar-workspace-list.tsx`).

Selected state on rows in a desktop list+detail uses `surfaceSidebarHover` as the background (`packages/app/src/screens/projects-screen.tsx`). Selected state on rows in the sidebar list uses `surface2` (`packages/app/src/components/agent-list.tsx:563-571`).

---

## 12. Status pills and badges

Status pills are `palette.<color>[300]` foreground on a 10%-alpha background of the same color. Success uses green, warning uses amber, danger uses red, muted uses zinc. The `<StatusBadge>` primitive (`packages/app/src/components/ui/status-badge.tsx`) is canonical.

Status dots — the small filled circles next to a host or agent name — are `borderRadius.full` filled with the status color (`statusSuccess`, `statusWarning`, `statusDanger`, or `foregroundMuted`). They sit in the trailing slot of a sidebar row or as a leading marker on a status pill.

The bespoke pills in `packages/app/src/screens/settings/host-page.tsx:97-116`, `packages/app/src/components/agent-list.tsx:607-632`, and `packages/app/src/components/sidebar-workspace-list.tsx:2889-2894` are drift to be removed. New code uses `<StatusBadge>`.

---

## 13. Forbidden

- `fontWeight.medium` on row titles, body text, button labels, badge text, or `<SidebarCallout>` titles. Medium is reserved for the structural-label tier described in §3 — section labels, modal/sheet titles, dense metadata emphasis, and tight action labels. Anything else is `normal`. `<ScreenTitle>` is responsive `400/300` and is never overridden.
- `<Pressable>` wrapping `<Text>` to make a button. `<Button>` exists.
- Bare `<Text>` for a section header inside settings. `<SettingsSection>` exists.
- A "Settings" CTA on a detail page. Detail pages are settings; settings is reached from the sidebar, the host entry, or a row's kebab menu.
- The word "checkout" in UI strings or identifiers. The term is "workspace".
- New color tokens or hardcoded hex outside the palette. Status pill rgba backgrounds are the documented pattern (§12), not a license.
- Placeholder text dimmed beyond `foregroundMuted`. No extra opacity, no italics, no ghost-text.
- `onPointerEnter` and `onPointerLeave`. They do not fire on native iOS. Hover uses Pressable's `onHoverIn`/`onHoverOut` gated with `isHovered || isCompact || isNative`.
- Raw DOM APIs without an `isWeb` guard.
- Spacing values outside the scale. `padding: 20` and `gap: 10` are wrong.
- Color changes for disabled state. Opacity only.
- Destructive actions without `confirmDialog`. Restart, remove, and future destructive actions are confirmed. Worktree archive is confirmed only when git runtime reports uncommitted changes or unpushed commits; clean pushed worktrees archive immediately.
- Bespoke status pills. `<StatusBadge>` is the pill primitive.
- Raw `Modal` for a focused task. `<AdaptiveModalSheet>` is the modal primitive.
- Importing `ActivityIndicator` directly. `<LoadingSpinner>` is the loading primitive.
