# Handoff Skill

Transfer the current task — context, decisions, failed attempts, constraints — to a fresh agent. The receiving agent starts with **zero context**, so the handoff prompt must be a self-contained briefing.

**User's arguments:** $ARGUMENTS

## Prerequisites

Read the **paseo** skill. Before choosing a provider, read `~/.paseo/orchestration-preferences.json` unless the user explicitly named a provider in this request. Do not create the receiving agent until you have read it.

## Parsing arguments

1. **Provider** — explicit user request first; otherwise resolve from `impl` preference (or `ui` if the task is styling-only).
2. **Worktree** — "in a worktree" / "worktree" → create a worktree via Paseo with a short branch name derived from the task, based on the current branch.
3. **Task description** — anything else the user said.

## The handoff prompt

The receiving agent has zero context. Include:

```
## Task
[Imperative description.]

## Context
[Why this task exists, required context.]

## Relevant files
- `path/to/file.ts` — [what it is and why it matters]

## Current state
[What's done, what works, what doesn't.]

## What was tried
- [Approach] — [why it failed or was abandoned]

## Decisions
- [Decision — rationale]

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] [Criterion]

## Constraints
- [Must-not / must-preserve]
```

**Preserve task semantics.** Investigate-only → "DO NOT edit files." Fix → "implement the fix." Refactor → "refactor, not rewrite." Carry the user's exact intent.

## Launch

Create the agent via Paseo with a `[Handoff] <task>` title, the briefing as initial prompt, `detached: true`, and cwd set to the worktree path if `--worktree`. Leave `notifyOnFinish` omitted unless the user explicitly wants no callback.

Handoff agents are siblings/root agents, not your subagents. They must survive you being archived and must not appear in your subagent track.

Don't wait by default — the user decides whether to follow along or move on. Tell them the agent ID and how to follow along (the paseo skill explains).
